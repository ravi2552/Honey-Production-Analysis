# Honey-Production-Analysis
**Objective:** To visualize how honey production has changed over the years(1998-2021) in the United States.

In 2006, global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component of American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of disappearing worker bees causing the remaining hive colony to collapse. Speculation as to the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been reached. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in America from 1998 to 2021.
