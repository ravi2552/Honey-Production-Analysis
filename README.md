# üçØHoney-Production-Analysis
**Objective:** To visualize how honey production has changed over the years(1998-2021) in the United States.<br><br><br>
In 2006, global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component of American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of disappearing worker bees causing the remaining hive colony to collapse. Speculation as to the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been reached. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in America from 1998 to 2021.<br><br><br>

**Honey Production in USA Dataset Column description:**<br>
‚óè state: Various states of the U.S.<br>
‚óè numcol: Number of honey-producing colonies. Honey-producing colonies are the maximum number of colonies from which honey was taken during the year. It is possible to take honey from colonies that did not survive the entire year<br>
‚óè yieldpercol: Honey yield per colony. Unit is pounds<br>
‚óè totalprod: Total production (numcol x yieldpercol). Unit is pounds<br>
‚óè stocks: Refers to stocks held by producers. Unit is pounds<br>
‚óè priceperlb: Refers to an average price per pound based on expanded sales. The unit is dollars.<br>
‚óè prodvalue: Value of production (totalprod x priceperlb). The unit is dollars.<br>
‚óè year: Year of production<br>

## Technologies Used
**Python:** Core programming language for data analysis.<br>
**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.<br>
**Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization tools.<br>
